I'm a research engineer with a passion for modelling, machine-learning, 
software engineering and mathematics. I mainly work in python, but also 
love working in lower level languages, especially C++ and Rust.

This blog contains write-ups of hobby projects I work on, usually covering 
aspects of the above. Some may only be partially successful (hopefully not
too many) but will aim to be at least interesting!

All the code for the projects here (and a few more) can be found on my
[github repository](https://github.com/zombie-einstein)
